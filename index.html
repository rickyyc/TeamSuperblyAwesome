		<h1> Rationale </h1>
			<div class="rationale-section">


				<p class="p-description">Using production methods and development techniques from throughout this course, our group created a proto-site and documents to support the redesign of the COMP1950 web site. There are things we liked about the current website: the simplicity, the efficiency, and the ease of use. We wanted to ensure we stuck with these core principles while still providing the website with a modern facelift and feature set.</p>

				<p class="p-description">The key features of the re-design are:</p>
					<ul class="p-description">
						<li><strong>CSS3 and HTML5</strong> - Welcome to 2014. We're all up to speed on the latest and greatest web technology. While the simplicity of the new design (and an HTML5shiv or two!) still allows older broswers to view, we've updated the backend for the future. Kid tested, W3C approved.</li>
						<li><strong>Mobile Compatibilty</strong> - While not specifically asked for, we felt that the end-user would really appreciate a mobile-friendly design. 60% of web browsing is done via mobile, and we believe that students will take advantage of this. Studying on the sky-train or the bus for regular quizzes is now easier than ever, thanks to the new design</li>
						<li><strong>Collapsable Content</strong> - All lectures and course content are now streamlined and quickly navigatable using accordian-style content separation. Study only the specific lecture content you need to know, and keep your screen free of unneccessary content. <em>"But what about my overhead notes?!"</em>, you're asking. We've taken care of that for you. Alternate style sheets provide block displaying of all elements, so all the material can be viewed at once- perfect for the projector or your printer.</li>
						<li><strong>Navigation</strong> - Static navigation that's always there when you need it.</li>
						<li><strong>Mmmm... Breadcrumbs</strong> - We've left a trail of these tasty morsels for everyone so they don't get lost. Looking at this week's homework, but want to look at last week's lecture? It's oh-so much quicker and easier to do now.</li>
						<li><strong>Online Quizzes</strong> - We're going green and saving trees! Forget those old ink and paper quizzes of yester-year, the new quizzes are now online. Quizzes are easy to design, and our custom-javascript backend ensures no-one accidently hits submit before they've answered all the questions.</li>
						<li><strong>Student Marks Page</strong> - We want it all in one place. Students will be able to login and view their current marks for the course, without the need to go to myBcit. Pretty javascript charts provide visual feedback on grade-distribution, so students can track their progress- then quickly review any course material they might have missed out on.</li>	
					</ul>
